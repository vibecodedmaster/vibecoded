  <h1>Policies & Disclaimer</h1>
  <p class="muted">The fine print. We wrote it so you don't have to.</p>

  <h2>What This Is</h2>
  <p>Vibe Coded is a community-curated registry of open-source projects. We list projects. That's it. We are not the projects. We are not the authors. We are not your lawyer, your doctor, or your financial advisor.</p>

  <h2>No Warranty</h2>
  <p>This site and its data are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We make no guarantees about accuracy, completeness, security, or whether that dependency you just added will break production at 3am. Use at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
  <p>Vulnerability information is sourced from public scanners and may be incomplete, outdated, or wrong. A "0 vulnerable" badge does not mean "secure." A "4 vulnerable" badge does not mean "on fire." Do your own due diligence.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
  <p>We link to external repositories and sites. We do not control, endorse, or vouch for them. If a project does something naughty, that's on them. If you clone a repo and it mines crypto on your machine, we're sorry but we told you to read the code.</p>

  <h2>Branding & Trademarks</h2>
  <p>Vibe Coded is an independent directory. Project names, logos, and trademarks belong to their respective owners. Listing a project here does not imply affiliation, endorsement, sponsorship, or partnership with Vibe Coded.</p>

  <h2>Source Linking & Evidence</h2>
  <p>We aim to link detected fields to public source evidence whenever possible (for example GitHub API endpoints, repository files, commit links, and Trivy scan targets). Some fields may be unavailable or temporarily missing if upstream APIs, repositories, or scans do not provide stable references.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the maintainers of this project shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of this site or reliance on its data. You clicked the link. You ran the code. You're an adult (probably).</p>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>Project data is collected from public GitHub APIs and stored in this repository. We do not log visitors, use analytics, or collect personal data. The site is static; nothing is sent to our servers when you browse. GitHub's own policies apply to data we fetch from them.</p>

  <h2>Data License</h2>
  <p>The registry data (projects.json and related) is released under the <strong>CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication</strong>. Use it, copy it, remix it, sell it, whatever. No attribution required. We mean it.</p>

  <h2>Contributions</h2>
  <p>By submitting data or code, you grant us a license to use it. We reserve the right to remove or modify content at our discretion. Don't submit stuff you don't have rights to.</p>

  <h2>That's All</h2>
  <p>If you're still reading, go build something cool. And maybe run <code>npm audit</code>.</p>
